## Pending fixes for issues:
  * members can't delete own posts.
  * members can still update posts that arn't theirs
  * the authorize_user in post_controller.rb code needs to be refactored.
  * if unauthorized user shows up on post edit page, the save button should be hidden as well. along with a alert saying you are not authorized to do this.
